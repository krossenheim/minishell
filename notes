// echo <>cat
// when no path and pwd = .
// minishell in a minishell and CTRL C
// echoa | cat -- executing cat
// script runs?, also, it runs a builting when ./builtin, instead of , trying to execute the file biulting in tihs directory


NOTES:
1 -When doing "sleep 5 | sleep 1", we cant leave usign ctrl-d or ctrl-c,
   maybe the child processes also dont have the signal and thats why they are not quitting?

2 -When doing "cat < not_existing_file",currently our cat waits for input instead of not running. 
   I've put a flag called 'cancel' on "t_hell" and it will be set to "true" if there was an issue with the infile, 
   so its available for you to handle this case.
