// echo <>cat
// when no path and pwd = .
// minishell in a minishell and CTRL C
// echoa | cat -- executing cat
// script runs?, also, it runs a builting when ./builtin, instead of , trying to execute the file biulting in tihs directory


NOTES:
1 -When doing "sleep 5 | sleep 1", we cant leave usign ctrl-d or ctrl-c,
   maybe the child processes also dont have the signal and thats why they are not quitting?

2 -When doing "cat < not_existing_file",currently our cat waits for input instead of not running. 
   I've put a flag called 'cancel' on "t_hell" so you could do something like
		->
		->	if (head->cancel == true)
		->		{
		->				head = head->next;
		->				continue ;
		->		}
		->
     in the execution loop.
